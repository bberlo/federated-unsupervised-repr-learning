### Requirements
In the requirements.txt file the needed python modules for this project are specified.

### Running experiments and plots
The code provided in this repository, since the work was conducted prior to the Research Data Management (RDM) plan introduction date of May 1, 2021, is provided on an 'as-is' basis.
This means that the code will have to be re-written, or included into another project, for it to work again.
The experiments were conducted with pre-processed datasets given by the practical supervisor.
Pre-processed datasets, including pre-processing scripts, used to conduct the experiments are also not provided.
The original datasets used throughout the experiments include MobiAct (https://bmi.hmu.gr/the-mobifall-and-mobiact-datasets-2/), HHAR (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heterogeneity+activity+recognition), and HAPT (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/smartphone-based+recognition+of+human+activities+and+postural+transitions).
