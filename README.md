### Requirements
In the requirements.txt file the needed python modules for this project are specified.

### Running experiments and plots
The code provided in this repository is provided on an 'as-is' basis.
The work was conducted at TU/e prior to the Research Data Management (RDM) plan introduction date of May 1, 2021.
This means that the code will have to be re-written, or included into another project, for it to work again.
The experiments were conducted with pre-processed datasets given by the practical supervisor.
Pre-processed datasets, including pre-processing scripts, used to conduct the experiments are also not provided.

The original datasets used throughout the experiments include: 
- MobiAct (https://bmi.hmu.gr/the-mobifall-and-mobiact-datasets-2/)
- HHAR (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heterogeneity+activity+recognition)
- HAPT (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/smartphone-based+recognition+of+human+activities+and+postural+transitions).
